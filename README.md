# Youtube_Statistics

Welcome to the GitHub repository showcasing my data analysis project centered around YouTube statistics. In this project, I've delved into a comprehensive exploration of YouTube data, from data cleaning and visualization to deriving powerful insights

The cornerstone of this project is data cleaning. I've employed advanced techniques to address outliers, employing box plots and statistical analyses. Through pandas properties like lambda functions, I've skillfully filled missing values. Statistics methods such as mean, mode, and median have played a pivotal role in enhancing data quality. To bring data to life, I've harnessed the power of Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. These visualization tools transformed raw data into insightful visual representations, enabling the identification of patterns and trends that drive YouTube engagement.

Taking the analysis a step further, I've constructed a dynamic Power BI dashboard. Utilizing DAX queries and Power Query, the dashboard provides detailed insights and allows for interactive exploration.

Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Dive into the Jupyter Notebook files to witness the data cleaning process and insights extraction.
3. Explore the Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization files to gain insights from visual representations.
4. Check out the Power BI dashboard to experience interactive insights.
Feel free to adapt this project for your own data exploration endeavors. Whether you're a data analysis enthusiast or aiming to improve your skills, this project offers a hands-on journey through YouTube data analysis.
